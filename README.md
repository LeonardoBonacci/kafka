=================
First, build the Kafka clients and add them to your maven repo.
[Here](https://github.com/LeonardoBonacci/kafka/blob/2.7-piggyback/piggyback/src/main/resources/commands.txt) are commands to do exactly that. Skip a few build steps to succeed.
Too lazy to build yourself? [Here](https://github.com/LeonardoBonacci/kafka/tree/2.7-piggyback/clients/build/libs) is the pre-build jar, which of course - for security and ethical reasons - you should not use.

Ready?
The 'piggyback' folder contains the producer and consumer.
