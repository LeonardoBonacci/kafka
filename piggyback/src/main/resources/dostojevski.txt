Staraya Koussa, August 16, 1880. 

Deeply esteemed and kindest Konstantin Petro- 
vich, I thank you from my whole soul for your good, 
splendid, enheartening letter. Enheartening, in- 
deed, for I, as a man, always need the encourage- 
ment of those in whom I believe, whose under- 
standing and convictions I deeply respect. Every 
time I write something and send it for publication 
— I am as in a fever. Not that I did not believe in 
what I myself had written, but always the question 
torments me : how will it be taken ? Will people 
want to understand the essence of the matter ? 
Would it not rather result in bad than in good 
that I made public my intimate convictions ? The 
more so that I am always compelled to express 
certain thoughts only in the basic idea, which 
always greatly needs a further development and 
argumentation. And the opinion of men like you 
— is positively my support ! It means then, I 
was not mistaken in everything, it means, I was 
understood by those whose understanding and 
impartial judgment I value, and, therefore, my 
labour was not in vain. 

I tell you frankly : now I am finishing the 
Karamazovs, This last part, I myself see and 
feel, is so original and unlike what others write, 
that I positively do not expect the approval of our 
critics ; the public, the readers — that is a different 
matter : they always supported me. I should be 
deeply grateful to you if you give your attention 
to what will be published in the August number 
of the Russky Viestnik (which is now being printed), 
and then in the September number where the fourth 
and last part of the Karamazovs ends. In the 
September book will be a trial, our crown-prose- 
cutors and advocates — all this will be shown in a 
particular light. The Journal of an Author I 
decided to bring out in the coming year without 
fail. The present, ' only number for this year,' 
has had an indubitable success with the public : 
in three days up to 3000 copies sold in Petersburg 
alone, and I brought out altogether 4200 copies. 
I think I shall have to publish a second edition. 
My wife told me how kindly you had received her. 
I thank you for sending me the Varshavsky Dnievnik, 
Leontiev after all is a bit of a heretic — did you notice 
it ? Anyhow, of this I shall talk to you in person, 
when I come to Petersburg at the end of Sep- 
tember ; there 's much of interest in his opinions. 
— Accept, deeply respected Konstantin Petrovich, 
the assurance not only of my sincerest feelings, 
but also of my profound, great hope for all the 
good which I expect, and not only myself, but 
every one, from your new splendid activity. — Your 
adherent and admirer F. Dostoevsky.
